            Since the Government has continued to deny all existence of 'Unknown Entities' we have been forced to go public.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information contained within this website is a combination of hard work amongst hackers, geeks, coders and investigators. We have scoured the internet, public libraries, government databases and all forms of classified and declassified information.
        </p>
        <p>
            We present to you the latest information that Governments around the world do not want you to know. You can make up your own mind
        </p>
        <p>
            We have created a database of all sightings of any 'Unknown Entities' that have been officially and unofficially recorded.
        </P>
        <p>
            If you have any information, images,dates sightings then please contact us so we can update our database.
        </p>
        <p>
            We would like to thank all of our contributors particularly those in Russia, Cuba, North Korea and underground nuclear bunkers in Saskatchewan, Canada.
